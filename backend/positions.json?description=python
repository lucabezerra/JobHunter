Our technology stack -- the one we’d like to hire you to help build -- makes this experience as seamless and full-featured as possible for every client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are expanding the engineering team that builds this tool into a self-service product across that entire range of clients. This means software components that do everything from furnish the end-user experience in the web browser or on the command line, to backend components that drive other portions of the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should be a proficient software engineer with at least one of the following languages:\nGo\nPHP\nJavaScript\nPython\nYou should also be proficient in the domain of web application development, with domain knowledge that broadly addresses at least some of the following areas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGit-based workflows and software projects across multiple repositories and codebases\nUser authentication and authorization flows between online web applications\nE-commerce workflows, recurring billing operations, reporting, etc.\nMulti-service or cross-application interaction and design\nImplementation of web applications according to open standards (i.e. RFCs et al.)\nJob Description\nWe do lots of everything here: from client libraries and the command-line interaction layer, to web applications that drive the end-user interface for the product, billing \u0026amp; reporting, user authentication \u0026amp; authorization, interaction with vendors or partners, and the occasional piece of staff tooling that interacts with that software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, we’re looking for engineers to help us build any and all of these pieces! We have serious web applications written in Go, PHP, Python, and JavaScript, all of which are critical to some part of our interaction layer for users. Taken together, they form a key piece of our cloud hosting and devops tooling product -- if you’re especially interested in the devops and cloud solutions space, then we’re especially interested in you. Being comfortable tackling programming problems from the architecture level all the way down to proper code implementation is also important to us -- though we are growing fast, the team is still small, the to-do list long, and engineers generally have a great deal of autonomy to implement features and drive the product forward.  Your contribution matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should be a proficient software engineer with at least one of these languages and be experienced with the domain of web application development.

All of this has made Platform.sh a great place to work, and we are proud of an extraordinary retention rate throughout the company’s entire history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe product we make is an advanced tool for cloud hosting and software engineering \u0026amp; development of web applications.
